            <h1>The journey so far.</h1>
            <p>I was on the hunt for a career that combined creativity with practicality—something that aligned with my passions and gave me room to grow. Having always enjoyed working with computers, web development seemed like the perfect match. It’s hands-on, fast-paced, and offers endless opportunities to create something from scratch.<br><br>

            After bouncing around a few online resources, I finally stumbled upon Scrimba, and it completely changed the game for me. Their interactive approach kept me motivated and made the material stick. The moment I completed my first fully functional project, I knew I was exactly where I was meant to be.</p>

                    <p>My very first satirical spin on the world of digital ownership. This NFT project pokes fun at the hype, buzzwords, and blurry JPEGs that sold for absurd amounts.</p>

                    <p>This handy little extension proves that useful tools don't need to be bloated or boring. I built it to simplify the process of saving and managing links—ideal for anyone who has 47 tabs open “for later.</p>

                    <p>Inspired by The Matrix, this splashpage dares visitors to escape the 9-to-5 simulation. With a hypnotic video background and neon-glow aesthetic, it's more than a landing page—it's a digital red pill.</p>
