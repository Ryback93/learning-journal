                <h1>Howdy! My name's Riley and welcome to my learning journal</h1>
                <p>I started my journey on Scrimba with a clear goal: to become a confident, job-ready web developer. Along the way, I've built a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and tackled hands-on projects. It's been challenging at times—especially learning solo—but every completed module and mini-project has boosted both my skills and confidence.</p>

            <h2>How I got started</h2>
            <p>I was looking for a more fulfilling career—something creative, practical, and aligned with what I actually enjoy doing. I’ve always liked working with computers, and web development felt like the perfect fit: it’s hands-on, constantly evolving, and gives you the power to build cool things from scratch.<br><br>
               After trying a few scattered resources online, I found Scrimba and it made all the difference. Their interactive lessons helped me stay engaged and actually retain what I was learning. Once I built my first functional project, I knew I was on the right path.</p>

            <h2>How I stay focused</h2>
            <p>Learning independently isn't always easy, but I’ve built some habits that keep me on track. I break my study time into focused blocks (hello, Pomodoro timer), keep distractions to a minimum (goodbye, social media—at least for a bit), and set small goals each day to stay motivated.
               I also remind myself why I started: to gain the freedom and confidence that come with being a skilled developer. That mindset helps me stay grounded, even on the tough days.</p>
